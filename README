LaTeX_LabBook for Remote servers
author Tom-Erik Haugen

This is a set of macros for writing a lab book on a remote server. Text can be
in blocks, then stored using the store.sh macro. When stored the text gets wrapped
in LaTeX code so it can be compiled. It is moved to the appropriate year/month/day
file.

Images can also be stored, they will be linked to in the current position of the tex
document, and moved to the appropriate year/month directory. This also uses the
store.sh macro

For the text to be appended in the Lab Book it should be written in a file called
LabBook.tex this will be appended by store.sh and the original file will be deleted.

LabBook:
	Each day has a .txt file and gets stored in the corresponding
	year and month subdirectory along with any relevant image macros.
	These are compiled together into a pdf using the compile_month.sh
	script.

store.sh:
	takes 1 argument which is the file to be stored. It will 
	concatenate the contents of this file to the LaTeX code for the day/month
	along with creating the file if needed, and timestamping the text. This 
	also deletes the text file

	Currently only accepts 3 formats of files:
	LabBook.tex : appends to the current tex document
	      *.png : moves to appropriate directory and links in text
		  *.C   : moves to appropriate directory and links to .png in text

	-L flag (late storage)
	takes 1 argument for file name, if -L flag is present it also takes day
	and month and stores in respective .tex file

	-I flag (image)
	moves an image to the directory and includes it as a graphic in the
	LaTeX document.
	< not implemented >

	-C flag (.C macro I guess...)
	moves a root .C macro to the directory, and includes the .png version 
	in the LaTeX document.

LabBook/compile_month.sh
	Takes 2 arguments, year, and month name. It will compile all of the 
	LaTeX code in that directory into one .tex document then compile it
	with pdflatex. 
	
	It should correctly link all images together. All root
	.C macros will be compiled to .png and linked in the text. After the 
	final .pdf is generated the .png images will be deleted
