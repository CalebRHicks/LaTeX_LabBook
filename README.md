# LaTeX Lab Book
This is a collection of scripts to write and compile a Lab Book on a remote server. It generates the appropriate wrapper files and linking between macros and text. The user needs to only write the text they want, and use the store script to append that text to the relevant day. 

## Installation
Currently this Lab Book works with a strict directory system. There is the parent working directory. This needs to be specified in the store.sh script, or else it will not run.

The parent directory must contain the store.sh script, and the LabBook directory. The LabBook directory contains the compile script which takes the LabBook source code and compiles into a pdf.

Recommended installation is to decide which directory is the parent directory, then pulling this git project. That will create the necessary subdirectory system, along with the header and footer files.
